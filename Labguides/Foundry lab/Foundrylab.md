# Lab 12 – Orchestrating multi-agent AI for retail using Copilot Studio and Microsoft Fabric

## Objective:

Build an intelligent, multi-agent retail assistant using Microsoft
Copilot Studio and Microsoft Fabric. In this lab, you
will design and implement a customer-facing AI system that orchestrates
across specialized agents to handle product discovery, customer support,
policy queries, and real-time operational insights.

## Scenario: “Zava Outdoor Retail Assistant”

A premium outdoor retail brand (focused on **camping & trekking gear**)
wants to build an intelligent assistant that:

- Helps customers **discover products** (backpacks, tents, accessories)

- Answers **policy-related questions** (returns, shipping, refunds)

- Handles **support queries**

- Provides **guided recommendations for outdoor trips**

## Exercise 1: Create Copilot Studio agent

In this exercise, you will create the primary Copilot Studio agent that
acts as the central interface for customer interactions. This agent will
be responsible for handling support queries and grounding responses
using enterprise knowledge sources.

### Task 1: Create the agent and configure knowledge sources

In this task, you will create the **TrailAssist Concierge** agent,
configure its behavior, and ground it with knowledge sources related to
shipping, returns, and customer support policies.

1.  Login to +++https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com/+++ with your login
    credentials

    - Username - +++@lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).Username+++

    - TAP - +++@lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).AccessToken+++

2.  Select **Get Started** to activate the Copilot Studio trial.

4.  Select **Edit** to edit the details of the agent and enter the below description and select **Save**.

    ```
    A customer-facing AI assistant that helps users with
    order support, returns, refunds, and shipping queries while coordinating
    with a product specialist agent for recommendations and product-specific
    details.
    ```

8.  Enter the below instructions and select **Save**.

    ```
    You are TrailAssist Concierge, a helpful and professional retail assistant for an outdoor gear company.

    Your responsibilities:
    - Answer questions related to returns, refunds, shipping, and customer support.
    - Use the provided knowledge base to give accurate answers.
    - If a question is about products (such as backpacks, tents, camping gear, recommendations, or comparisons), delegate the query to the connected product specialist agent.
    - Always provide clear, structured, and polite responses.

    Guidelines:
    - Be concise but informative.
    - If unsure, ask clarifying questions.
    - Do not hallucinate product details—rely on the product agent.

    `A data-driven AI agent that provides real-time insights on orders, inventory, customer activity, and operational metrics using structured data from Fabric Lakehouse.`

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/entrprsagntscpltstdfrntr/refs/heads/main/Labguides/Foundry%20lab/media/image83.png)

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/entrprsagntscpltstdfrntr/refs/heads/main/Labguides/Foundry%20lab/media/image84.png)

You have successfully integrated the Fabric Data Agent, enabling the
Copilot Studio agent to access real-time operational insights.

### Task 4: Test the agent

In this task, you will test the end-to-end solution to validate that the
Copilot Studio agent orchestrates across all connected agents.

1.  Select the **Test** pane.

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/entrprsagntscpltstdfrntr/refs/heads/main/Labguides/Foundry%20lab/media/image85.png)

2.  Enter +++Show the recent orders+++ and click **Send**. **Allow**
    connection for the first time to proceed.

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/entrprsagntscpltstdfrntr/refs/heads/main/Labguides/Foundry%20lab/media/image86.png)

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/entrprsagntscpltstdfrntr/refs/heads/main/Labguides/Foundry%20lab/media/image87.png)

3.  Navigate to the **Activity** tab to view the result. You can also
    see that the agent has internally called the **Fabric Data Agent**
    to answer the question.

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/entrprsagntscpltstdfrntr/refs/heads/main/Labguides/Foundry%20lab/media/image88.png)

4.  Send +++Which products are low in stock?+++ questions in the Test
    pane and see the output coming from the Fabric Data agent.

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/entrprsagntscpltstdfrntr/refs/heads/main/Labguides/Foundry%20lab/media/image89.png)

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technofocus-pte/entrprsagntscpltstdfrntr/refs/heads/main/Labguides/Foundry%20lab/media/image90.png)

    The Copilot Studio base agent now orchestrates the request to the
Foundry or Fabric agents or answers itself based on the type of the
question and the purpose of the agent.

    You have validated that the Copilot Studio agent can intelligently route
queries and orchestrate responses across multiple specialized agents.

    You have successfully completed the multi-agent architecture by adding a
data-driven agent, enabling real-time insights and advanced
orchestration.

## Summary:

In this lab, you created the **Retail Assistant**, a modern AI solution
for an outdoor retail company. You began by building a Copilot Studio
agent that serves as the primary customer interface for handling support
and policy-related queries. You then
added a Fabric Data Agent to enable real-time insights from structured
business data such as orders and inventory.

Now, you will have implemented a fully functional multi-agent system
that demonstrates orchestration, specialization, and data-driven
intelligence.
